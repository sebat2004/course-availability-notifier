# OSU Waitlist Reminder Extension

Are you tired of continuously checking the OSU course registration page to check the availability of a class with no waitlist? Look no further! This extension allows the OSU students to be notified by email when a spot opens up in a course that you want to track! After you login, all it takes is one button click to be signed up to receive an email when a course you are tracking has a spot for you.
