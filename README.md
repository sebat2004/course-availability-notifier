<h1 align="center">OSU Waitlist Reminder Extension</h1>

## Description
Are you tired of needing to check the availability of an OSU class with no waitlist? Look no further! This extension allows the OSU students to be notified by email when a spot opens up in a course that they want to track! 

After you log in, all it takes is one button click to be signed up to receive an email when a course you are tracking has a spot for you.
